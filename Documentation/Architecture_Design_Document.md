# Product Architecture Design Document

## 1. Overview

**Product Name:** Automated Pinterest Money Flow

**Purpose:**  
The system automates the process of researching trending products, scraping Amazon best sellers, generating Pinterest pins, and posting them on a schedule. It is designed as a microservices-based platform to allow scalability, reusability, and integration with future projects.

**Key Features:**  
- Automated research and scraping of trending products
- Data extraction and storage (using PostgreSQL)
- Integration of existing pin generation, posting, and account management modules
- Scheduling of posts using APScheduler (with a future upgrade to n8n)
- A clear separation of backend services and a React-based frontend dashboard
- Role-based access control for administrative and user-level access

---

## 2. Architectural Style

- **Microservices Mindset:**  
  The system will be decomposed into independent services for scraping, posting, and scheduling. Each service will have clearly defined interfaces (or contracts) so that components can be reused or extended in future projects.  
  - **Scraping Service:** Responsible for navigating Amazon Best Sellers pages, extracting product data, and storing results.
  - **Posting Service:** Handles pin generation (using existing code), account management, and posting to Pinterest.
  - **Scheduling Service:** Manages the timing of scraping and posting tasks using APScheduler initially, with a roadmap toward integrating n8n for workflow orchestration.

- **Backend and Frontend Separation:**  
  The backend will expose RESTful APIs (or GraphQL endpoints) for core functionalities, while the frontend is built in React. This separation ensures flexibility in scaling and updating each component independently.

---

## 3. Deployment and Infrastructure

- **Development Environment:**  
  Development will be done on macOS using Python (with a virtual environment).

- **Production Environment:**  
  Deployment will occur on a remote Contabo VPS running Ubuntu.  
  - **Containerization:**  
    Docker is planned for future updates to simplify deployment and ensure consistency across environments. A Docker container setup can be added once the MVP is stable.
  - **VPN Consideration:**  
    For Pinterest posting, VPNs may be utilized to avoid rate limits. The architecture will include a configuration option to specify VPN or proxy settings for the Posting Service.

---

## 4. Data Storage and Database

- **Database Choice:**  
  PostgreSQL is selected for storing scraped data and user configurations.  
  - **Data Export:**  
    The system will support data export (e.g., CSV, JSON) to allow for external analysis.
  - **Backup & Multi-Tenancy:**  
    While backups will be implemented only when necessary, the architecture will plan for multi-tenant support to allow future SaaS deployment for multiple users. This can be enabled by adding tenant identifiers in the database schema and implementing access control at the API level.

---

## 5. Scheduling and Job Processing

- **Current Scheduling Approach:**  
  The system will initially use APScheduler to schedule scraping and posting jobs.  
- **Future Integration:**  
  A roadmap is in place to integrate n8n for more advanced workflow orchestration and monitoring.

---

## 6. Module Integration and Interfaces

- **Single Codebase Integration:**  
  For the MVP, pin generation, posting, account management, and writer functionality will be integrated into a single codebase.
- **Clear Interfaces:**  
  Each module (e.g., Scraper, Pinner, Writer) will have a clearly defined interface (using abstract classes or interface contracts) to ensure that future modules (e.g., additional social channels or new marketplaces) can be plugged in without impacting existing functionality.
- **Plugin System:**  
  The design will consider a plugin-like system to add new modules or services (for instance, additional posting platforms) with minimal changes to the core codebase.

---

## 7. Security and Authentication

- **API Keys and Credentials:**  
  Sensitive data (API keys, passwords) will be stored in secure `.env` files initially.  
  - **Future Considerations:**  
    Explore using secure vault solutions (such as HashiCorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager) if the product scales.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**  
  The dashboard will include RBAC to distinguish between administrators and standard users. The backend API will enforce access controls based on roles.
- **Secure Communication:**  
  All communications between services (and between the frontend and backend) should be secured via HTTPS.

---

## 8. Logging, Monitoring, and Error Handling

- **Robust Logging:**  
  Each microservice will implement robust logging to capture detailed information for troubleshooting. Logs may be centralized using tools like ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) in the future.
- **Error Handling:**  
  All services will have verbose error handling. Errors will be:
  - Logged in detail for developers.
  - Translated into clear, user-friendly error messages when displayed in the dashboard.
- **Notifications:**  
  In case of critical failures (e.g., posting errors), the system will notify users immediately via the dashboard and optionally via email or SMS.

---

## 9. Frontend and User Interface

- **Frontend Technology:**  
  The dashboard will be built using React, providing a responsive, modern user interface.
- **UI Features:**  
  - **Login and Role-Based Access:** Secure login screens and user management.
  - **Campaign Overview:** Visual summaries, calendars, and charts for scheduled posts and performance metrics.
  - **Customization Tools:** Interfaces for reviewing and adjusting generated pins, scheduling posts, and managing multiple projects.
  - **Real-Time Notifications:** Alerting users of errors or system status changes.
- **API Integration:**  
  The React frontend will communicate with the backend via RESTful or GraphQL APIs to retrieve data and trigger actions.

---

## 10. Future Scalability and Extensibility

- **Microservices Architecture:**  
  The independent nature of each service allows scaling each component (e.g., deploying multiple instances of the scraping service) based on load.
- **Extensible Modules:**  
  With clear interfaces and a plugin system, additional functionalities (e.g., posting to other platforms, integration with additional marketplaces) can be added with minimal disruption.
- **Multi-Tenant Support:**  
  While not immediately implemented, the architecture will be designed to support multiple users by isolating tenant data and enforcing role-based access controls.

## 11. Questions and Next Steps

Before finalizing this document, please review and consider:
- Are there any additional third-party integrations or specific tools you’d like to include in the microservices (e.g., a particular monitoring tool)?
- Do you have preferences on how to approach containerization with Docker initially, or should that be deferred to a later stage?
- Are there any specific data export formats or reporting requirements we haven’t covered?

Once these questions are answered, we can refine this architecture design and begin implementation planning.
