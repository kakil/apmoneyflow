# Functional Requirements Document

## 1. Trending Product Research
- **Automatic Identification:**  
  The system will automatically navigate to the Amazon Best Sellers pages to collect trending products in order.
- **Scheduling & Control:**  
  - The research process runs on a configurable schedule (e.g., daily at a set time).  
  - The user can manually start and stop the research process via the command line (and later via a dashboard).

## 2. Product Data Extraction
- **Data Fields to Extract:**  
  For each trending product, the system will extract:
  - Product Name  
  - Product Image URL  
  - Product Description  
  - Product Summary Video  
  - Affiliate Link
- **Future Expansion Placeholders:**  
  Include placeholders for:
  - Product Price  
  - Reviews  
  - Ratings

## 3. Data Storage
- **Database Selection:**  
  The system will use a database (e.g., SQLite for the MVP, with potential upgrade to PostgreSQL or another RDBMS for scalability) to store product details.
- **Export Capability:**  
  The database should support exporting data to common formats (e.g., CSV, JSON).
- **Backup:**  
  While full backup functionality is deferred, the design should allow for future backup enhancements.

## 4. Pinterest Pin Generation
- **Integration with Existing Code:**  
  The system will integrate with existing modules for generating Pinterest pins, using the provided codebase as a template.
- **Content Composition:**  
  Generated pins will include the product name, image, description, and later on may integrate additional branding elements if needed.

## 5. Pinterest Posting
- **Posting Method:**  
  The system will use existing posting code (whether via API calls or browser automation) to submit pins to Pinterest.
- **Affiliate Link Attachment:**  
  Each pin will include the affiliate link extracted during product data extraction.

## 6. Scheduling and Timing
- **Time Zone Awareness:**  
  Users will specify posting times based on their current time zone.
- **Frequency and Timing Options:**  
  The system will allow configuration of:
  - How many times per day posts are made  
  - Specific posting times for each project
- **User Control:**  
  The user can start/stop scheduled posting as needed.

## 7. Multi-Project / Project Management
- **Multiple Projects Support:**  
  The system will support multiple projects (e.g., best-selling books, electronics, home decor) by:
  - Storing project-specific data in separate folders or databases  
  - Allowing the user to start and stop individual projects independently
- **Ideas for Future Expansion:**  
  - A dashboard to manage project configurations and view statuses  
  - A unified control panel for scheduling and monitoring all projects

# Non-Functional Requirements Document

## 1. Performance and Scalability
- **Concurrent Projects:**  
  The system should handle 1–5 concurrent projects per day, with each project processing 3–5 products.
- **Response Time:**  
  Processing and posting should occur within acceptable time limits to ensure timely updates.

## 2. Reliability and Availability
- **Error Handling:**  
  Robust error handling and retry mechanisms will be implemented for web scraping and posting tasks.
- **User Notifications:**  
  If posting fails or an error occurs, the system will immediately notify the user (initially via console logs; later via dashboard alerts).

## 3. Security
- **API Keys and Authentication:**  
  All API keys and user credentials must be securely stored (using environment variables and secure configuration files).
- **Database Security:**  
  Basic security measures will be implemented to ensure that stored data is protected from unauthorized access.
- **Compliance:**  
  Future releases may include enhanced security protocols as needed.

## 4. Maintainability and Extensibility
- **Modular Design:**  
  The system will adhere to SOLID principles, ensuring that each module (e.g., research, scraping, posting) has a single responsibility.
- **Ease of Future Integration:**  
  The architecture must allow for adding support for additional social media platforms (blogs, Medium, Reddit, etc.) and new product marketplaces (Temu, Aliexpress, Clickbank, etc.) with minimal refactoring.
- **Code Quality:**  
  The code will be well-documented and include unit tests for each module to facilitate maintenance and future development.

## 5. Usability
- **User Interface:**  
  - **MVP:** Initially, the system will be operated via the command line.  
  - **Future Release:** A dashboard will be developed for scheduling, monitoring, and configuring project settings.
- **Documentation:**  
  Comprehensive user and developer documentation will be provided to ensure ease of setup and use.
