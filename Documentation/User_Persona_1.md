#### **Background & Experience**
- **Professional Experience:**  
  Amanda has been involved in affiliate marketing for over 7 years. She runs several niche websites and social media channels focused on lifestyle, home decor, and tech gadgets. Her experience has taught her that time is money; automating repetitive tasks is crucial for scaling her business.
- **Technical Skill:**  
  While not a full-time developer, Amanda is comfortable with basic tech tools and command-line interfaces. She often collaborates with freelance developers to customize automation solutions.  
- **Motivations:**  
  She seeks efficient systems that minimize manual work, allowing her to focus on strategy, content quality, and expanding her affiliate networks.

#### **Goals & Needs**
- **Efficiency & Automation:**  
  Amanda needs a reliable automation tool that identifies trending products, generates engaging Pinterest pins, and posts them according to a smart schedule.  
- **Data-Driven Decisions:**  
  She values systems that collect and store data in a way that she can analyze later, ideally with an option for exporting reports.
- **Ease of Use & Management:**  
  The ideal solution would have a straightforward command-line interface for the MVP, with a plan to scale into a dashboard for managing multiple projects seamlessly.
- **Scalability & Flexibility:**  
  Amanda is planning to expand into new markets (e.g., additional social media channels and marketplaces) and therefore needs a modular, easily extensible system.

---

#### **Pain Points**
- **Manual Data Entry & Scraping:**  
  Currently, Amanda spends too much time manually checking Amazon best sellers and creating Pinterest pins, which limits her focus on higher-level marketing strategies.
- **Inconsistent Posting:**  
  Without automation, the timing and frequency of her posts are inconsistent, reducing potential affiliate earnings.
- **Technical Complexity:**  
  Some automation tools on the market are either too simplistic or overly complicated, and she needs a solution that strikes a balance between functionality and ease of customization.
- **Lack of Multi-Project Support:**  
  Managing multiple affiliate niches requires a tool that can handle distinct projects without mixing data or processes.

---

#### **Behavior & Preferences**
- **Tech Adoption:**  
  Amanda is an early adopter of digital marketing tools and is always on the lookout for solutions that give her a competitive edge.
- **Communication Style:**  
  She prefers clear, concise documentation and step-by-step guides to understand how to configure and use new systems.
- **Decision Drivers:**  
  Cost-effectiveness, ease of integration with existing tools (e.g., Pinterest API, affiliate networks), and the promise of reduced manual workload are key factors influencing her decisions.

---

#### **Ideal User Scenario**
Amanda logs into her command-line interface in the morning. The tool automatically starts by scraping the latest Amazon best sellers, extracts key product details, generates visually appealing Pinterest pins using her predefined templates, and schedules posts throughout the day based on her local time zone. She receives notifications if any part of the process fails, allowing her to quickly intervene if necessary. Over time, Amanda analyzes exported data to refine her affiliate strategies, expand into new niches, and ultimately scale her business.
